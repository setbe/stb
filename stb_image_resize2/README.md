# stb_image_resize2 (status)

This repo includes `stb_image_resize2/stb_image_resize2.hpp`.

Status: minimal/WIP. The intent is to keep it header-only and freestanding-friendly where possible.

Planned/expected docs here:
- supported resize filters
- pixel formats / channel layouts
- performance notes
- deterministic tests
