# stb_image (status)

This repository includes `stb_image/stb_image.hpp` as part of a larger “freestanding stb” effort.

Right now this area is work-in-progress rewrite

If you want to contribute, please keep these goals in mind:
- freestanding support (optional),
- clean C++ structure,
- deterministic, testable behavior.

If/when a full decoder rewrite lands, this README should be expanded with:
- supported formats,
- security notes,
- integration hooks,
- tests and examples.
